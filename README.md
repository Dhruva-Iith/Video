# Video

In The Video_Magnification.m file, A video is taken and Low passed spatially then band passed temporally. The video output was then magnified.
This would be make the blood flow visible to the naked eye. Using the face_detection.m file, The face is located and few pixels are randomly 
chosen and the intensity vs the frame of the red color is plotted using the intensity_plot_auto.m file. The number of peaks in the graph would
give the heart rate over those frames. When normalized we get the heart rate of the person.
